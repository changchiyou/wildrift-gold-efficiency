A website combining the gold efficiency calculation formula from [<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/e/e6/Site-logo.png" width="17" height="17">](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_efficiency_(Wild_Rift)) with the design elements from [<img src="https://wr-meta.com/favicon.png" width="15" height="15">](https://wr-meta.com/items/), featuring manually updated item data for [Wild Rift](https://wildrift.leagueoflegends.com/).

## Backstory

Being a data enthusiast, I found the concept of Gold Efficiency mentioned in [<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/e/e6/Site-logo.png" width="17" height="17"> Gold efficiency (Wild Rift) | League of Legends Wiki](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_efficiency_(Wild_Rift)) highly intriguing. However, upon initial inspection, I noticed that the website contained a multitude of outdated and erroneous item data. Moreover, its disorganized layout made reading difficult, rendering it unsuitable for direct use.

After some time, I came across another website, [<img src="https://wr-meta.com/favicon.png" width="15" height="15"> WR META - LoL Wild Rift All Items and Runes](https://wr-meta.com/items/), which drew me in with its sleek and elegant design, as well as its CSS style. Although it also suffered from the issue of outdated and inaccurate item data, I had an idea:

Merging the calculation **formula** from [<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/e/e6/Site-logo.png" width="17" height="17">](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_efficiency_(Wild_Rift)) with the **style** of [<img src="https://wr-meta.com/favicon.png" width="15" height="15">](https://wr-meta.com/items/), and **manually updating** the item data myself. Thus, this website was born out of this concept.
